# CommandSkript

CommandSkript is a tiny language base on [Tiny Language for ANTLR 4](https://github.com/bkiers/tiny-language-antlr4) 
with some modifications.  It is designed to automate the process of sending commands within a Minecraft server. 
For example, the following skript would cause the server to say "Hello" 5 times:
```
for a = 1 to 5 do
    qx('say Hello');
end
```
